# `ixbrl-parse`

## Introduction

- Python library code, parses iXBRL files.
- Script `ixbrl-to-csv` outputs iXBRL tagged data in a CSV format.
- Script `ixbrl-to-rdf` emits iXBRL tagged data in RDF.

## Development

There's a bunch of sample iXBRL files grabbed from various places in
the `ixbrl` directory: US 10-K and 10-Q filings, a few random things
from UK companies house, and a couple of sample ESEF filings.  This is the
data I've tested with.

Also, `accts.html` is a sample file created using
[`gnucash-ixbrl`](https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-ixbrl).

## Installation

pip3 install git+https://github.com/cybermaggedon/ixrbl-parse
